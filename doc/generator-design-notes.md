## Generating Constants for Static Properties

*(from implementation-notes.md, "Lisp Packages for C# Classes")*

The `assembly-package-generator.lisp` tool generates Lisp bindings for .NET assemblies.
By default, it generates static properties (like `Vector2.Zero` or `Color.White`) as dynamic
symbol macros via `(define-symbol-macro ...)` since they are technically properties, not
constant fields, and reflection cannot distinguish whether a static read-only property's
value could change.

However, many types like `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2` and `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color`
have properties that act identically to constants. To optimize these, the `--constant-properties`
command-line flag was added to the generator. It accepts a comma-separated list of properties
to treat as compile-time constants (evaluated at macro-expansion load-time in Lisp using
`defconstant`). Passing `*` (e.g., `--constant-properties "*"`) marks all read-only
static properties of the class as constants.

Example Usage:
```bash
dotcl-packagegen --out-dir cspackages --assembly MonoGame.Framework.dll --class Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color --constant-properties "*"
```

(Current versions of the tool take an assembly `.dll` directly and reflect its metadata as
part of the same invocation; see `README.md`/`CLAUDE.md` for the up-to-date CLI shape.)
This forces properties like `Color.White` to be emitted as `(defconstant +white+ ...)`
instead of `(define-symbol-macro white ...)` improving performance and avoiding repeated
reflection evaluations.

## Direct Method Calls via Type Declarations

*(from implementation-notes.md)*

Starting in DotCL 0.1.11, method calls on C# instances can be optimized to direct
calls (avoiding runtime reflection and boxing/unboxing overhead, resulting in an
approximate 3.5x performance increase) by wrapping the receiver object in a
type declaration using the `the` operator.

The syntax for declaring a .NET type for a receiver is:
```lisp
(the (dotnet "Fully.Qualified.TypeName") receiver-form)
```

For instance, in `assembly-package-generator.lisp`, instance method stubs are
automatically optimized for reference types (classes/interfaces, excluding
structs and enums which are value types and not yet supported by `the` casting)
like so:
```lisp
(defun dispose (obj!)
  (dotnet:invoke (the (dotnet "Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.SamplerState") obj!) "Dispose"))
```

If the actual object passed at runtime does not match the declared type, DotCL
will raise a `DotCL.LispErrorException` indicating the invalid cast.

## .NET CLOS Integration in DotCL 0.1.9

*(from implementation-notes.md)*

DotCL 0.1.9 introduces the ability for CLOS generic functions (`defgeneric`)
to dispatch natively on instances of C# classes created via `dotnet:define-class`
as well as raw C# framework types (e.g., `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2`).

### Class Registration and Naming

When DotCL encounters a native C# object for the first time, or when `(class-of obj)`
is explicitly called on it, DotCL lazily creates a CLOS wrapper class for the .NET type.
This wrapper is placed in the `dotcl-internal` package and named after the short name
of the C# class.
For example, `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2` becomes `dotcl-internal::|Vector2|`.

Internally, this registration happens in the DotCL compiler/runtime source code within
`Runtime.CLOS.cs`, specifically in the `EnsureDotNetTypeClass(Type type)` function.
This function creates a new `LispClass` and inserts it into the global `_classRegistry`
dictionary, mapping the simple C# name (and its uppercase variant) to the CLOS class wrapper.
Because `EnsureDotNetTypeClass` recursively calls itself on the type's `BaseType`, invoking
`class-of` on a C# object recursively creates a Lisp class hierarchy that accurately mirrors
the .NET inheritance tree (e.g. `System.ValueType`, `System.Object`).

**This is directly relevant to the generator**: every generated package registers its
class via `(dotnet:static "DotCL.Runtime" "EnsureDotNetTypeClass" (dotnet:resolve-type "..."))`,
so the caveats below apply to anyone writing `defmethod`s against generated packages' types.

To specialize a `defmethod` on a raw C# type, use an internal symbol as the class specializer:
```lisp
(defmethod get-x ((obj dotcl-internal::|Vector2|))
  (dotnet:invoke obj "X"))
```

### Warning: Namespace Collision (Bug?)

Because `EnsureDotNetTypeClass` explicitly uses the *short name* of the C# type
(`type.Name` instead of `type.FullName`), it is impossible to distinguish between
classes with the same name in different namespaces (e.g., `System.Object`
and `Dougs.Special.Object`).

When DotCL encounters the first of these classes, it registers `dotcl-internal::|Object|`
and maps the C# type to it. When it encounters the second class, it queries `_classRegistry`
with the same short name, finds the existing CLOS wrapper, and binds the second C# type to
the exact same CLOS class.

Consequences:
1. **Broken Method Dispatch**: A `defmethod` targeting `dotcl-internal::|Object|` will
   fire indiscriminately for instances of both `System.Object` and `Dougs.Special.Object`.
   It is not possible to specialize methods for one but not the other.
2. **Broken Inheritance**: The `ClassPrecedenceList` in Lisp is evaluated only for the first
   type registered. The second type completely loses its own inheritance tree in the Lisp
   layer and silently adopts the CPL of the first class.

### The Compile-Time Constraint

In Common Lisp, `defmethod` is a macro that expands at compile time. During this
expansion, it calls `find-class` to verify the existence of the class being specialized.

If a top-level `(defmethod ... ((obj dotcl-internal::|Vector2|)) ...)` is included statically
in code compiled by the standalone DotCL compiler (which only loads standard .NET runtime
libraries, not application-specific assemblies like a generated package's target assembly),
the compiler will attempt to resolve `Vector2`, fail to find the assembly, and hard-crash
compilation with `FIND-CLASS: no class named Vector2` or
`DOTNET: type not found: Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2`.

### Workarounds

**Option 1: The `eval` Workaround** — defer the macro-expansion of `defmethod` until
*runtime*, when the target assembly is fully loaded, by quoting the method definition
and passing it to `eval` inside a function:
```lisp
(defun register-clr-methods ()
  ;; 1. Force the registration of the CLOS wrapper class.
  (dotnet:static "DotCL.Runtime" "EnsureDotNetTypeClass"
                 (dotnet:resolve-type "Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2"))
  ;; 2. Dynamically evaluate the defmethod at runtime.
  (eval '(defmethod get-x ((obj dotcl-internal::|Vector2|))
           (dotnet:invoke obj "X"))))
```

**Option 2: Loading Assemblies at Compile Time** — use `eval-when` to explicitly load the
required assembly `.dll` and register types during both `:compile-toplevel` and
`:load-toplevel` phases, so standard top-level `defmethod` forms work natively:
```lisp
(eval-when (:compile-toplevel)
  (dotnet:load-assembly "/path/to/Assembly.dll")
  (dotnet:static "DotCL.Runtime" "EnsureDotNetTypeClass"
    (dotnet:resolve-type "Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2")))

(eval-when (:load-toplevel :execute)
  (dotnet:static "DotCL.Runtime" "EnsureDotNetTypeClass" (dotnet:resolve-type "Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2")))

(defmethod get-x ((obj dotcl-internal::|Vector2|))
  (dotnet:invoke obj "X"))
```

### Defining C# Types from Lisp

When defining new C# proxy classes from Lisp using `dotnet:define-class` (or its
underlying components), always pass parameter and field types as fully-qualified strings
(e.g., `"System.Double"`) instead of unquoted symbols (e.g., `System.Double`).
Symbols without string qualification might fail to resolve during macro expansion if the
namespace environment isn't strictly controlled, whereas explicit string declarations
correctly guide DotCL's internal reflection (`dotnet:resolve-type`).

## Parentheses Balance Checking

*(from implementation-notes.md, "Mismatched Parentheses in Common Lisp")*

Mismatched parentheses in Common Lisp can lead to extremely confusing compilation
errors, such as package lookup failures or symbols being reported as not external.
This occurs because an extra or missing parenthesis can cause the Lisp reader
to exit a macro definition or top-level form prematurely, causing subsequent forms
to be parsed in the wrong context or skipped entirely.

As soon as any compilation problems or other errors are encountered, the parentheses
balance of all modified files must be checked individually. See `check_parens.py`
and the `make check-parens` / `make test` targets in this project's own `BUILD.md`
for the tooling that implements this check (ported from `dotcl-dungeonslime`).

## Instance Properties and Struct "Boxing Mutation"

*(originally from implementation-notes.md; corrected in Version 29 — see that section
below for the full story of what was wrong and how it was found)*

The generator (`assembly-package-generator.lisp`) emits accessor (`property-name`)
and mutator (`(setf property-name)`) functions for C# instance properties.

A struct (value type) obtained from Lisp — via `dotnet:new`, `dotnet:static`, a property
getter, or a stored constant — is never a raw unboxed Lisp value; it's a `#<DOTNET ...>`
reference to a boxed CLR object. Invoking a setter on an instance property of that boxed
struct via `dotnet:invoke`'s `setf`-expansion mutates *that exact boxed instance* directly
— it does **not** discard the mutation on some separate throwaway copy. This holds
regardless of how the new value argument is itself produced (`dotnet:box`, a real invoked
conversion call, or a `the`-typed literal all behave identically here).

The practical caveat this leaves is not "the mutation is lost" but the opposite: **if
that boxed instance is aliased anywhere else** — another Lisp variable bound to the same
object, or (much more importantly) a `defconstant` constant that was only ever
one-time-evaluated to that exact box — mutating it through any one alias mutates it for
every other alias too. See the Version 29 section below for why this makes
`--constant-properties`-selected struct constants (e.g. `Vector2.Zero`, `Color.White`)
a genuine hazard, and `FEATURES.md`'s "Struct Boxing Caveat" section for user-facing
guidance.

In addition, Lisp properties with only a setter (write-only properties) are generated
with the name `set-propertyname` and accept the receiver as the first argument:
`(set-propertyname obj! new-value)`.

### Example Transcript

Real, verified `make repl` output against `dotcl-dungeonslime` (loads generated packages
including `color:`):

```lisp
DUNGEON-SLIME> (defparameter x color:+white+)
DUNGEON-SLIME> x
#<DOTNET Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color {R:255 G:255 B:255 A:255}>
DUNGEON-SLIME> (setf (color:r x) (dotnet:box 37 "System.Byte"))
DUNGEON-SLIME> x
#<DOTNET Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color {R:37 G:255 B:255 A:255}>
DUNGEON-SLIME> (setf (color:r x) (dotnet:static "System.Convert" "ToByte" 40))
DUNGEON-SLIME> x
#<DOTNET Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color {R:40 G:255 B:255 A:255}>
DUNGEON-SLIME> (setf (color:r x) (the (dotnet "System.Byte") 55))
DUNGEON-SLIME> x
#<DOTNET Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color {R:55 G:255 B:255 A:255}>
DUNGEON-SLIME> color:+white+
#<DOTNET Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color {R:55 G:255 B:255 A:255}>
```

Note the last line: `color:+white+` — a `defconstant` — was itself permanently mutated.
This is the shared-mutable-constant hazard described in the Version 29 section below.

## TimeSpan Standard Operator Dispatchers

*(from implementation-notes.md, "Local Nickname Migration and TimeSpan Operator Dispatchers")*

Standard operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` are overloaded in C#'s
`System.TimeSpan`. The package generator emitted generic runtime dispatchers for
these, passing the operator strings directly to `dotnet:static` (e.g., `(apply
#'dotnet:static <type-str> "+" args)`).

However, .NET static operators compiled in IL have special names (such as
`op_Addition`, `op_UnaryPlus`, `op_Subtraction`, `op_UnaryNegation`,
`op_Multiply`, `op_Division`), so calling `"+"` or `"-"` directly via
`dotnet:static` results in `System.MissingMethodException`.

To fix this, the operators inside a generated `system-time-span.lisp` were
refactored to perform type and argument count dispatching purely in Lisp,
calling the correct typed static method wrapper functions:
* **`-`**: Calls `--time-span-time-span` (`op_Subtraction`) for 2 arguments, or
  `--time-span` (`op_UnaryNegation`) for 1 argument.
* **`+`**: Calls `+-time-span-time-span` (`op_Addition`) for 2 arguments, or
  `+-time-span` (`op_UnaryPlus`) for 1 argument.
* **`*`**: Inspects if the first argument is a C# object (via
  `monoutils:dotnet-p`) to dispatch to `*-time-span-double` (`op_Multiply`) or
  `*-double-time-span` (`op_Multiply`).
* **`/`**: Inspects if the second argument is a C# object (via
  `monoutils:dotnet-p`) to dispatch to `/-time-span-time-span` (`op_Division`)
  or `/-time-span-double` (`op_Division`).

# Generator Version History (Detailed Design Notes)

The generator's own `*generator-version*` docstring in `assembly-package-generator.lisp`
has the authoritative one-line-per-version changelog. The sections below are the fuller
design rationale for several versions, extracted from `implementation-notes.md` and
`opencode-implementation-notes.md`.

## C# Assembly Package Generator v10: Method Overload Support

*(from opencode-implementation-notes.md)*

### Overview

This documents the implementation of version 10 of the
`assembly-package-generator.lisp`, which adds automatic generation of
method wrappers for overloaded C# methods. Previously (v9), only
non-overloaded "simple" methods were generated. Methods with multiple
overloads like `Vector2.DistanceSquared`, `Rectangle.Intersects`, and
`Rectangle.Contains` were skipped entirely, requiring hand-written wrappers.

Version 10 introduces a method classification system that categorizes
overloads as "clean" (no ref/out/params/defaults) or "dirty" (has
special parameter modifiers), and generates appropriate wrappers for
each case.

### Method Classification

Four helper functions were added:

- **`clean-method-p`** — Like `simple-method-p` but without the unique-name
  check; returns t if a method has no ref/out/params/defaults/generics.
- **`dirty-method-p`** — Returns t if a method has ref/out/params/defaults.
  Complement to `clean-method-p`.
- **`method-overload-name`** — Generates a disambiguated Lisp function name
  by appending kebab-cased simple parameter type names. E.g.,
  `Contains(Vector2)` → `contains-vector-2`.
- **`method-signature-str`** — Returns a human-readable signature string for
  doc-comments, e.g., `Contains(ref Rectangle, out bool) → void`.

### Overload Handling Categories

Methods are grouped by name. Each group falls into one of four cases:

1. **No clean overloads** (all dirty): Emit a doc-comment listing the
   skipped overloads. No functions generated.
2. **Single clean overload**: Generate a single typed function with
   the base name. Includes `(the (dotnet "Type") obj)` typed-call
   optimization for value type receivers. Emits doc-comment for any
   accompanying dirty overloads.
3. **Multiple clean overloads** (2+): Generate a passthrough &rest
   function that dispatches at runtime via DotCL's overload resolver,
   plus per-overload typed functions with type-suffixed names for
   direct invocation. Emits doc-comment for any dirty overloads.
4. **Operators and accessors**: Unchanged from v9 — handled separately
   by existing `op_`/`get_`/`set_` prefix filtering.

### Value-Type Typed-Call Optimization

In v9, the `(the (dotnet "Type") obj)` wrapper was only emitted for
reference-type (class) receivers. Value types (structs) used bare
`(dotnet:invoke obj ...)`. In v10, the wrapper is emitted for ALL
receivers, including value types. DotCL 0.1.11 supports the
`constrained.` + `callvirt` IL pattern needed for value type virtual
dispatch via typed declarations.

### Static Method Argument Type Hints

For single-clean-overload static methods, the generated code now wraps
each argument in `(the (dotnet "<type>") arg)` to improve DotCL's
caching efficiency.

## C# Generic Method Wrappers (Generator Version 12)

*(from implementation-notes.md, "C# Generic Function Type Checking Refactoring")*

To support invoking generic methods of exactly one type argument from Lisp, the C# Lisp Package Generator has been enhanced:

* **Metadata Extraction**: `AssemblyToLispy.cs` formats generic methods by exporting `:is-generic t` and `:generic-arity [count]` (retrieved via `method.IsGenericMethod` and `method.GetGenericArguments().Length`).
* **Schema Validation**: Updated the testing schema (`tests/framework.lisp` and the metadata test suite) to allow `:is-generic` and `:generic-arity` keywords inside method property lists, preventing validation failures.
* **Method Classification**: Modified `simple-method-p` and `clean-method-p` in `assembly-package-generator.lisp` to support generic methods if their generic arity is exactly 1.
* **Wrapper Generation**: Generated Lisp functions take the `type` parameter (supporting type name string, alias, or System.Type object) as the first argument (or second argument after `obj` for instance methods). The wrapper delegates invocation to DotCL's `dotnet:invoke-generic` or `dotnet:static-generic` interop targets by passing `(list type)` as the type arguments list.

## C# Package Object Constructors (Version 11)

*(from implementation-notes.md, "Chapter 16: SpriteFont Text Rendering")*

### Struct Parameterless Constructor Injection
In .NET Reflection, value types (structs) do not return their implicit parameterless constructor
via `GetConstructors()`. To generate the correct parameterless `new` constructors for value types,
the generator (`assembly-package-generator.lisp`) checks if the type is a struct (`:kind :struct`).
If it is a struct and no zero-parameter constructor is found in the metadata, the generator
injects a default parameterless constructor `(:parameters nil :public t)` into its internal
constructors list.

### Overload Collision Prevention
For types with multiple clean constructors, the generator outputs a runtime dispatch `new`
function using `&rest` arguments. Additionally, type-suffixed constructors (e.g.,
`new-single-single`) are generated for performance or explicit dispatch. However, if a
constructor has zero parameters, its type-suffixed name would be `new`, colliding with and
overwriting the runtime dispatch `new` function.
To resolve this collision, the generator skips creating the type-suffixed function for any
zero-parameter constructor when a type has multiple clean constructors. The runtime dispatch
`new` function handles the parameterless case correctly when called without arguments: `(new)`.

## C# Operator Overload Dispatch in Package Generator (Generator Version 13 & 14)

*(from implementation-notes.md)*

### 1. Type-Based Operator Dispatching (Version 13)
The C# Lisp Package Generator has been enhanced in Version 13 to automatically generate type- and argument-count-aware dispatch wrappers for C# operator overloads (methods whose name starts with `"op_"` in C#, such as `op_Addition` and `op_Subtraction`, which are mapped to Lisp symbols like `+` and `-`):
* **Runtime Dispatch**: For overloaded operators, instead of outputting generic `(apply #'dotnet:static ...)` calls with raw operator symbols (e.g. `"+"` or `"-"`) which fail with `System.MissingMethodException`, the generator now emits a Lisp `cond` block.
* **Overload Selection**: The `cond` block inspects the runtime argument count and types (numbers, booleans, strings, or `.NET` objects) and dispatches the call to the corresponding type-suffixed generated overload functions (e.g. `+-time-span-time-span` or `*-time-span-double`).
* **Safe Fallback**: If no overload matches the argument patterns, a descriptive runtime error is thrown.

### 2. Standard Lisp Package Qualification (Version 14)
When standard Lisp operators (like `=`) are shadowed in a generated package (like `:system-time-span` shadowing `=`), any un-qualified calls to `=` in that package will resolve to the shadowed operator rather than the standard Common Lisp comparison function `cl:=`.
* **The Bug**: In Version 13, the generated test conditions (e.g. `(= (length args) 2)`) inside `:system-time-span` resolved to `system-time-span:=`. This caused recursive dispatch attempts with integer arguments (e.g. calling `op_Equality(int, int)`), leading to `MissingMethodException`.
* **The Fix**: In Version 14, the generator qualified all standard Lisp comparison operations in generated tests using the `cl:` package prefix (e.g., `(cl:= (length args) 2)`), ensuring they are evaluated as built-in Lisp functions rather than shadowed operator wrappers.

## Namespace Safety & Standard Lisp Symbol Protection (Version 15)

*(from implementation-notes.md)*

The Lisp Package Generator has been enhanced in Version 15 to establish complete namespace safety, preventing generated wrappers from shadowing critical Lisp syntax symbols and resolving symbol name collisions.

### 1. Mapping Special Forms & Reserved Words
In Common Lisp, symbols like `quote` and `function` are special operators used by reader macros `'` and `#'`. If a package shadows them, reader macros expand to package-local symbols (e.g. `microsoft-xna-framework-vector2:quote`), which crashes Lisp evaluation.
* **The Bug**: When generating wrappers for types containing members named `Quote`, `Function`, `T`, or `Nil`, the generator would output Lisp symbols like `quote` and `function` and place them in the package's `:shadow` list, causing syntax/compilation failures.
* **The Fix**: Version 15 maps C# member names named `Quote`, `Function`, `T`, or `Nil` to safe names `quote!`, `function!`, `t!`, and `nil!` respectively. This keeps them out of the package's `:shadow` list and preserves standard Common Lisp reader behavior.

### 2. Standard Lisp Symbol Qualification
To prevent other shadowed symbols in generated packages (such as `length`, `nth`, `cond`, `and`, `or`, `error`, `setf`, `defun`, `apply`, `function`, `the`, `list`, `numberp`, `typep`, `stringp`, `boolean`, `t`, etc.) from colliding with standard Lisp operators inside generated templates, the generator now qualifies all standard Lisp operators in generated templates with the `cl:` package prefix.
* **Examples**:
  - `(cond ...)` -> `(cl:cond ...)`
  - `(length args)` -> `(cl:length args)`
  - `(and ...)` -> `(cl:and ...)`
  - `(nth idx args)` -> `(cl:nth idx args)`
  - `(defun ...)` -> `(cl:defun ...)`
  - `(apply ...)` -> `(cl:apply ...)`
  - `(the ...)` -> `(cl:the ...)`
  - `(setf ...)` -> `(cl:setf ...)`
  - `(error ...)` -> `(cl:error ...)`
This prevents type-cast exceptions like `Unable to cast object of type 'DotCL.Cons' to type 'DotCL.LispDotNetObject'` when calling generated operator functions.

## Struct Mutation, Boxing, and Overload Resolution (Version 16)

*(from implementation-notes.md — excerpt; the source file's "Workaround" subsection is
DungeonSlime-specific game code and is not reproduced here)*

### 1. Static vs. Instance Method Name Collisions

In C#, a class can define an instance method and a static method with the exact same name. For example, `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2` defines:
- `public void Normalize()` — an instance method that normalizes the vector in-place (returns `void`).
- `public static Vector2 Normalize(Vector2 value)` — a static method that returns a new normalized vector.

In the Lisp wrapper package generator, methods are grouped by name to generate overload dispatchers. Because both methods are named `Normalize`, they were grouped together. However:
- The generator previously determined if a method group was static based on the first method in that group. Since the instance method `Normalize()` appeared first, the entire group was classified as non-static (`static-p` is `nil`).
- Consequently, the static overload was generated as an instance method `normalize-vector2` (incorrectly expecting an `obj` receiver and using `dotnet:invoke` on it), and the passthrough dispatcher `normalize` was overwritten by a 1-argument instance wrapper `(cl:defun normalize (obj))`.

In Version 16, this was resolved by tracking `is-static-overload-p` per individual clean method overload (via `(getf cm :is-static)`) rather than using the group-wide `static-p`. This ensures that static overloads grouped with instance methods (such as `Vector2.Normalize(Vector2)`) are correctly generated as static wrappers utilizing `dotnet:static` without requiring an implicit `obj` receiver.

### 2. Struct Boxing & In-Place Mutation Failures

C# structures (like `Vector2` or `Color`) are value types (structs). In the Common Lisp / DotNet CLR interop layer, invoking any instance method on a value type receiver (such as calling the instance method `Normalize()` on a `Vector2` instance) requires boxing the structure into a heap-allocated `.NET` object wrapper.

Any mutations performed by that instance method are applied only to the boxed copy on the heap. Once the method invocation returns, the boxed copy is discarded, and the original Lisp reference or local variable remains completely unmodified.

Furthermore, because the instance method `Normalize()` returns `void`, the Lisp wrapper function evaluates to `nil`. Consequently:
1. Calling something like `(v2:normalize (v2:new normal-x normal-y))` returns `nil`.
2. The original vector is not normalized (since the mutation was performed on a boxed copy that was immediately discarded).
3. The resulting `nil` normal vector can cause subsequent operations relying on the "mutated" value to fail silently or behave incorrectly.

**Workaround**: callers should prefer static methods returning a new struct instance (or a
hand-written Lisp-native helper) over relying on in-place instance-method mutation of structs.

## Idiomatic Lisp Naming Conventions (Version 17)

*(from implementation-notes.md)*

To make C# package wrappers feel more idiomatic to Common Lisp developers, Version 17 of the C# Lisp Package Generator updates the naming conventions for specific types of methods and fields:

### 1. NaN and IsNaN Mapping
- **`NaN` Constant**: Mapped directly to `"nan"` in `camel-to-kebab` so that constant wrappers for `NaN` (such as `System.Double.NaN`) generate as `+nan+` instead of the literal kebab-case `+na-n+`.
- **`IsNaN` Methods**: Mapped to `"nan?"` instead of the literal `is-na-n`.

### 2. IsSomething Boolean Predicates Suffix
- Any method or property whose C# name starts with `"Is"` followed by an uppercase letter (e.g. `IsEmpty`, `IsActive`, `IsFinite`) is translated to a Lisp predicate ending with a question mark `?` (e.g. `empty?`, `active?`, `finite?`), replacing the `is-` prefix.
- If the name is exactly `"Is"` or does not start with an uppercase letter following "Is" (e.g. `"Issue"`), the name is translated normally without the question mark conversion.

## C# Package Overload Resolution Enhancements (Version 18)

*(from implementation-notes.md)*

To support seamless interop for overloaded C# methods, the Lisp Package Generator implements Version 18 overload resolution rules:

### 1. Index-Based Positional Prefix Determination
Previously, the generator determined the common positional parameter prefix across overloads based on both name matching and lack of default values. However, C# overloads can use different parameter names for the same positional slots (e.g. `FromMilliseconds(double value)` vs `FromMilliseconds(long milliseconds)`).
- **Rule**: The positional prefix is now determined solely by the lack of default values up to `min-len` of the overloads, ignoring parameter names.
- **Variable Mapping**: Positional parameters are mapped in the generated master wrapper lambda list using parameter names from the first overload. During invocation code generation (`format-master-overload-action`), parameters are mapped back by positional index rather than name, ensuring variables are correctly bound and passed to the C# interop.

### 2. Literal Package Names in Fallback Conditions
When an overloaded method call fails to match any valid C# signature at runtime, the generator signals a `csharp-overload-not-found` error.
- **Fix**: The package name parameter is now generated as a literal string constant computed at generation time (e.g. `"MICROSOFT-XNA-FRAMEWORK-VECTOR2"`) rather than querying `(cl:package-name *package*)` at runtime. This guarantees accurate, package-independent diagnostics.

### 3. Optional Positional Overload Dispatch
To support overloaded methods like binary/unary operators (e.g. `TimeSpan.+` and `Vector2.+`) and multi-arity positional methods (e.g., `Rectangle.Contains`), the generator determines optional positional parameters beyond the minimum overload parameter length:
- **Maximum Mandatory Length**: The generator computes `max-mandatory-parameter-len` across all overloads.
- **Optional Parameter Collection**: Positional parameters between `min-len` and `max-mandatory-len` are generated in the master wrapper lambda list using `cl:&optional` (with `supplied-p` variables) instead of keyword arguments.
- **Strict Dispatching**: Master wrapper `cond` clauses evaluate both argument type checks and `supplied-p` presence flags to accurately dispatch to the correct C# overload signature.

## Nested Type Package Naming (Version 19)

C#'s CIL representation separates a nested type from its enclosing type with
a `+` (e.g. `Type.FullName` for `Glyph` nested inside `SpriteFont` is
`Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.SpriteFont+Glyph`). `AssemblyToLispy.cs`
uses this value verbatim for `:fully-qualified-name`, and it must stay
verbatim there: `monoutils:get-type`, `dotnet:resolve-type`, and `dotnet:the`
type hints all require the literal `+`-form to resolve the live CLR type.

Before Version 19, `camel-to-kebab` — which derives the generated Lisp
package name and output filename from `:fully-qualified-name` — only
special-cased `.` (mapping it to `-`); every other character, including
`+`, was copied through unchanged. This leaked a literal `+` into the
package/file name, plus a spurious extra hyphen from the uppercase-letter
hyphen-insertion logic misreading the `+` as "not already a separator"
(e.g. `microsoft-xna-framework-graphics-sprite-font+-glyph.lisp`).

**First attempt (reverted)**: making `camel-to-kebab` itself treat `+` like
`.` seemed like the obvious fix, but `camel-to-kebab` is *also* applied to
already-mapped member/operator names, not just type names — and
`AssemblyToLispy.cs` maps the C# `+` operator (`op_Addition`) to the
literal one-character Lisp name `"+"` upstream (see its operator-name
mangling table). Passing that already-correct `"+"` through a `+`-aware
`camel-to-kebab` silently turned `System.TimeSpan`'s `(cl:defun + ...)`
master wrapper into `(cl:defun - ...)` — a working operator turned into a
different, wrong one, with no error anywhere. Caught by `make test`'s
`cspackages-test/` diff showing an unrelated-looking change in
`system-time-span.lisp`.

**Actual fix**: a new, narrowly-scoped `type-fq-name-to-pkg-name` helper
wraps `camel-to-kebab`, substituting `+` → `-` in the input *before*
camel-casing — but only at the two call sites that convert a *type's*
`fully-qualified-name` to a display name (`generate-class-file`'s
`pkg-name`/`output-file`, and the `csharp-overload-not-found` condition's
`:package-name` slot). `camel-to-kebab` itself is completely unchanged, so
every other caller (member names, parameter names, and already-mapped
operator symbols like `+`, `-`, `=`) is unaffected:

```
Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.SpriteFont+Glyph
  -> microsoft-xna-framework-graphics-sprite-font-glyph
AssemblyToLispyTestTarget.NestingContainer+NestedLevel2+NestedLevel3
  -> assembly-to-lispy-test-target-nesting-container-nested-level2-nested-level3
```

Every reflection-facing use of `fq-name` (`<type>`, `<type-str>`,
`dotnet:resolve-type`, `dotnet:the` hints) reads it raw, never through
`type-fq-name-to-pkg-name` or `camel-to-kebab` — a nested type's generated
package still resolves the correct live CLR type via its `+`-separated
`<type-str>`.

## Generic Type Backtick Sanitization (Version 20)

Discovered immediately after Version 19, while adding an open-generic type
(`System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary\`2`) to the checked-in test
packages for the first time: .NET's open-generic-type names carry a
backtick-and-arity suffix (`` `N ``, e.g. `` Dictionary`2 `` or
`` System.Action`4 ``, per `AssemblyToLispy.cs`'s
`GetSimplifiedTypeName`/backtick-formatting helpers — see
`doc/assembly-to-lispy.md`). Like `+`, this backtick was previously copied
through `type-fq-name-to-pkg-name`/`camel-to-kebab` unchanged into the
generated package name and filename.

Unlike `+`, a raw backtick isn't merely an unwanted-but-inert character —
it is a Lisp reader macro character (the backquote/quasiquote prefix).
`(cl:defpackage :system-collections-generic-dictionary\`2 ...)` does
*not* read back as one symbol token followed by `defpackage`'s options
list; the reader stops the symbol token at the backtick and starts a new
backquote form there, so it actually parses as
`(CL:DEFPACKAGE :SYSTEM-COLLECTIONS-GENERIC-DICTIONARY (QUOTE 2) ...)` —
silently corrupting the form (wrong package name, and `(quote 2)` where
`(:use :cl)` was supposed to be) rather than raising an error anywhere. No
existing test caught this because nothing had previously fed a
backtick-bearing type all the way through `generate-class-file`; earlier
uses of backtick names in this codebase were metadata-only string
comparisons (e.g. matching `:name` in `tests/synthetic-target.test.lisp`),
never round-tripped through the Lisp reader.

**Fix**: `type-fq-name-to-pkg-name` now also flattens `` ` `` to `-`,
alongside `+`, before camel-casing. Unlike `+`, backtick is never
legitimately part of a member/operator name anywhere in this codebase
(only `Type.Name`/`Type.FullName` ever carry it, per
`AssemblyToLispy.cs`), so there is no analogous risk of corrupting an
intentional single-character Lisp symbol — the substitution still lives in
`type-fq-name-to-pkg-name` rather than `camel-to-kebab`, to keep all
type-name sanitization in one place:

```
System.Action`4                                        -> system-action-4
System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2                 -> system-collections-generic-dictionary-2
System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2+KeyCollection    -> system-collections-generic-dictionary-2-key-collection
```

## Batch ASDF System Generation (Version 21)

A single-pass invocation now also writes a `csharp-assembly-packages.asd` into `--out-dir`,
alongside the generated `.lisp` package files, so the whole batch can be loaded with one
`(asdf:load-system "csharp-assembly-packages")` instead of hand-writing a system definition or a
pile of `(load ...)` calls.

`generate-batch-asd-file` (`assembly-package-generator.lisp`) is called from
`generate-assembly-packages-batch` once every requested class's `.lisp` file has been written.
It reuses `type-fq-name-to-pkg-name` — the same function `generate-class-file` uses for the
file's actual name — so each `:components` entry (`(:file "<pkg-name>")`) is guaranteed to match
a real generated file, in the same order the classes were requested on the command line.

* `:version` is the short, 2-digit `*generator-version*` (this generator-behavior-shape version,
  e.g. `"21"`).
* `:long-description` additionally records the full `dotcl-packagegen` CLI/application version
  (obtained via a new `utils:get-system-version`, a non-printing counterpart to the existing
  `utils:print-system-version` used by `--version`), the generation timestamp, and, per assembly,
  each requested class's fully-qualified name, assigned package name, and any
  constant-properties.
* No `:depends-on` is emitted yet, even though every generated package's runtime code needs
  `monoutils`/`utils` (provided by this repo's own `dotcl-packagegen` system) — deferred to a
  later version.

## Consolidated packages.lisp (Version 22)

Class `.lisp` files no longer emit their own `(cl:defpackage ...)`. Instead, a single-pass
invocation writes one `packages.lisp` into `--out-dir` holding every requested class's
`defpackage` form, and each class file keeps only its `(cl:in-package :<pkg-name>)` — the
package must already exist by the time a class file is loaded.

The export/shadow-symbol computation that used to live inline inside `generate-class-file` was
extracted into `compute-package-exports-and-shadows` (same field/property/method-group walk, same
deduplication, same CL-external-symbol shadow detection — no behavior change), so both
`generate-class-file` (which still needs `pkg-name` for its `in-package` form) and the new
`generate-batch-packages-file` share one source of truth for a class's export list.

`generate-batch-packages-file` follows the same accumulate-then-write-once pattern as
`generate-batch-asd-file` (Version 21): it is called from `generate-assembly-packages-batch`
with the full `entries-with-resolved` list, before the per-class `generate-class-file` loop runs,
so `packages.lisp` exists on disk ahead of the files that depend on it. Each package's
`defpackage` form is preceded by a 3-line comment block:

```lisp
;;; Source File: some-class1.lisp
;;; C# Class: Some.Namespace.Type1
;;; Constant Properties: (none)
(cl:defpackage :some-namespace-type1
  ...)
```

`Constant Properties` prints the comma-joined list passed via `--constant-properties` (matching
the format already used in the `.asd`'s `:long-description`), or the literal `(none)` when empty,
so every block has the same 3-line shape regardless of whether constant properties were
requested. One blank line separates each package's block from the next.

Because class files now depend on `packages.lisp` having been loaded first, `generate-batch-asd-file`
(Version 21) was updated to reflect that dependency explicitly rather than relying on component-list
order alone: `csharp-assembly-packages.asd`'s `:components` now lists `(:file "packages")` first,
and every class `:file` entry gains `:depends-on ("packages")`.

## Self-Contained Runtime Support (Version 23)

Generated output previously referenced this tool's own `monoutils`/`utils` packages at three
runtime call sites — but a batch handed to a downstream project never shipped those packages, so
generated code was never actually self-contained, contrary to this repo's stated goal.
Investigation found `monoutils:dotnet-p`/`boxed-dotnet-p` are not portable Lisp at all: they are
native primitives registered into DotCL by this tool's own `MonoUtilsRegistrar.Initialize()`
(`MonoUtils.cs`), unreachable from any host that doesn't happen to load this exact assembly.

Two of the three call sites had a stock-DotCL equivalent already available (DotCL 0.1.15,
`Runtime.DotNet.cs`), so no custom code needs to ship for them at all:

* The per-class `<type>` constant (`(cl:defconstant <type> ...)`) now calls `dotnet:resolve-type`
  directly instead of `monoutils:get-type` — the latter only ever wrapped that same call for a
  string argument, the only way generated code ever invoked it, and `dotnet:resolve-type` is
  already used a few lines later in the same file for CLOS type registration.
* `format-param-type-check`'s fallback for non-primitive C# parameter types now emits
  `(dotnet:object-type arg)` (returns the wrapped `Type`, truthy, if `arg` is a
  `LispDotNetObject`/`LispDotNetBoxed`; `NIL` otherwise) instead of `(monoutils:dotnet-p arg)` —
  an exact drop-in replacement with identical semantics, no native registration required.

The third — the `csharp-overload-not-found` condition raised by master-overload dispatch
fallback clauses — is genuine custom Lisp logic (a `cl:define-condition`) with no stock
equivalent, so it now ships with every batch: a single-pass invocation writes
`csharp-assembly-utils.lisp` into `--out-dir` (`generate-batch-utils-file`, mirroring
`generate-batch-asd-file`'s accumulate-then-write-once shape), and emitted `cl:error` forms
reference `csharp-assembly-utils:csharp-overload-not-found` instead of
`utils:csharp-overload-not-found`.

Following the Version 22 convention that every `defpackage` form lives in `packages.lisp`, the
`csharp-assembly-utils` package's `defpackage` is *not* in `csharp-assembly-utils.lisp` — it's
written into `packages.lisp` (via `generate-batch-packages-file`) ahead of the per-class
`defpackage` loop, and `csharp-assembly-utils.lisp` itself only has `(cl:in-package
:csharp-assembly-utils)` plus the condition definition, exactly the shape every class file
already has relative to `packages.lisp`.

Both pieces of static content — the `defpackage` form and the condition definition — are copied
verbatim from two new, real, hand-written, independently loadable and `check_parens.py`-able
source files: `csharp-assembly-utils-package.template.lisp` and
`csharp-assembly-utils.template.lisp`. `generate-batch-packages-file`/`generate-batch-utils-file`
read them with `uiop:read-file-string` rather than reconstructing their content via `format`
calls, so the actual known-good, testable source is what ships, not a generator-code
approximation of it. Both templates are named with a `.template.lisp` double extension (not bare
`.lisp`) and copied next to the built executable via `dotcl-packagegen.csproj`'s `<Content>`
pattern — the same one already used for `dotcl-packagegen.asd`'s own version introspection —
and `Program.cs` resolves and passes both paths down as two new scalar arguments on the
`RUN-ASSEMBLY-PACKAGE-GENERATOR-BATCH` call.

`csharp-assembly-packages.asd`'s `:components` gained `(:file "csharp-assembly-utils"
:depends-on ("packages"))` (its `in-package` form needs that package to already exist), and
every per-class `:file`'s `:depends-on` became `("packages" "csharp-assembly-utils")`, since
class bodies now reference `csharp-assembly-utils:csharp-overload-not-found`.

## Overload Consolidation (Version 24)

Every overloaded method already got a single dispatching "Master Wrapper" (Version 18) — a
`defun` with `&optional`/`&key (var init supplied-p)` parameters and a `cond` block that
inspects argument types/`supplied-p` flags to invoke the exact right C# overload. But
`generate-class-file` *also* kept emitting one type-suffixed direct-call function per clean
overload alongside that wrapper (e.g. `contains-vector-2`, `get-ambiguous-time-offsets-date-time`),
purely as an optional fast/explicit path — and exporting all of them. For methods with many
overloads this produced exactly the long, ugly export lists `PLAN.md`'s "Overload Consolidation"
section called out. Since the Master Wrapper's `cond` dispatch already selects the correct
overload with full precision, these functions were redundant, not load-bearing, and Version 24
removes their generation and export entirely (`generate-class-file`, `compute-package-exports-and-shadows`).
`method-overload-name`/`constructor-overload-name` remain as internal helper functions (still
exercised directly by `package-generator-tests.lisp`) but are no longer called from the
generation path.

Constructors never had a Master Wrapper — multiple clean constructors instead got a bare
`(cl:defun new (cl:&rest args) (cl:apply #'dotnet:new <type-str> args))` passthrough (relying on
DotCL's own runtime overload resolution) plus the same type-suffixed direct-call functions
(`new-single-single`, etc.). Version 24 gives constructors a real Master Wrapper too
(`generate-constructor-master-wrapper`), built from the same helpers the method wrapper uses
(`common-parameter-prefix`, `max-mandatory-parameter-len`, `collect-optional-positional-params`,
`collect-key-params`, `format-master-overload-condition` — none of which depend on
static/instance-ness or a method name, so they're directly reusable) plus a new
`format-constructor-master-overload-action` that emits `(dotnet:new <type-str> ...)` instead of
`dotnet:invoke`/`dotnet:static`. `master-overload-param-names` was factored out of
`format-master-overload-action` to share the prefix/optional/keyword→positional-index parameter
name mapping between the method and constructor action formatters. This also makes the
Version 11 zero-parameter-constructor-name-collision workaround moot: since there's no longer a
type-suffixed `new` (which is what collided with the dispatcher's own `new` name), there's
nothing left to special-case.

To avoid losing the per-overload documentation that lived in the deleted functions' docstrings,
every Master Wrapper's docstring (method or constructor) now enumerates every overload it covers:
a header line, then one block per overload with that overload's human-readable signature
(`method-signature-str`/`constructor-signature-str`) followed by its own XML-doc-sourced
Summary/Returns/Parameters text (reusing `build-docstring`), indented underneath. Two new helpers
implement this: `format-overload-doc-block` (one overload's block) and
`format-combined-overloads-docstring` (the full docstring, called with `#'method-signature-str`
or `#'constructor-signature-str` depending on which kind of overload group it's covering).

### Positional Parameter Name Collisions (Constructor Master Wrapper)

Giving constructors a Master Wrapper immediately surfaced a latent bug in
`collect-optional-positional-params`, previously unreachable because nothing exercised the
Master Wrapper machinery on an overload group whose arities aren't a single monotonically-growing
family. For each positional dispatch slot beyond the common mandatory prefix, that function picks
its representative parameter from whichever overload happens to be first (in metadata order) with
a parameter present at that index — but nothing guarantees overloads at different indices don't
reuse the same parameter name for unrelated purposes. `System.TimeSpan`'s constructors are a real
example: `new(Int32 hours, Int32 minutes, Int32 seconds)` and
`new(Int32 days, Int32 hours, Int32 minutes, Int32 seconds)` both have a `seconds` parameter, but
at index 2 and index 3 respectively — two genuinely different slots that happened to share a
name. Emitting both as `(cl:defun new (... seconds ... seconds ...))` is an invalid lambda list
(duplicate variable).

`uniquify-positional-params` fixes this generically: given the ordered `prefix` ++ `opt-params`
list, it renames (via a numeric suffix, e.g. `seconds2`) any slot whose mapped Lisp name collides
with an earlier slot's. Both `generate-master-wrapper` (methods) and
`generate-constructor-master-wrapper` (constructors) run their raw `prefix`/`opt-params` through it
before building the lambda list, so every downstream consumer (`format-master-overload-condition`,
`master-overload-param-names`, `format-supplied-args-expr`) sees already-unique names without
needing its own collision logic — this exact latent bug applies equally to methods, not just
constructors, though no case in the checked-in test packages happened to trigger it there.

## Receiver Parameter Renamed to `obj!` (Version 25)

Every instance method/property wrapper's hardcoded receiver parameter was literally named
`obj` (`generate-single-overload`, `generate-master-wrapper`, `format-master-overload-action`,
and the instance-property getter/setter generation in `generate-class-file`). This collides
when the underlying C# method has its own parameter also named `obj` — e.g.
`System.Object.Equals(object obj)` mapped its one C# parameter to the Lisp name `obj` (via
`map-param-name`, which is a near-identity mapping for a name that's already lowercase and has
no reserved-word conflict), producing the invalid lambda list `(cl:defun equals (obj obj) ...)`.

The fix renames the hardcoded receiver to `obj!` everywhere it's emitted. This name is
collision-proof by construction: `map-param-name` (the *only* function that turns a C# parameter
name into a generated Lisp parameter name) only ever kebab-cases the name and, for the two
reserved words it special-cases, appends `-val` (`t` → `t-val`, `nil` → `nil-val`) — it never
appends a trailing `!`. That suffix is only ever produced by `map-member-name`, for *method/property
names*, not parameter names. So no C# parameter, regardless of its name, can ever map to `obj!`.
This mirrors the existing "protect a name the generator itself needs" pattern established in
Version 15 for `quote!`/`function!`/`t!`/`nil!`.

## Indexer Support (Version 26)

Prior to Version 26, `AssemblyToLispy.cs`'s `FormatPropertyPlist` never called
`PropertyInfo.GetIndexParameters()`, so a C# indexer (`this[...]`) reached the generator
indistinguishable from an ordinary parameterless property. `generate-class-file`'s instance-property
loop then emitted a getter/setter taking only the receiver (`obj!`) — e.g.
`Dictionary<TKey,TValue>`'s indexer became `(cl:defun item (obj!) ... "get_Item")`, silently
dropping the required `key` argument. This wasn't just an unimplemented feature: the generated
function *looked* correct (it compiled, exported, and had a plausible name) but could never
actually retrieve or store a value at runtime — calling it would either error out inside
`dotnet:invoke` (wrong arity for `get_Item`) or, worse, silently misbehave.

**The fix, in two parts:**

1. **Reflection (`AssemblyToLispy.cs`)**: `FormatPropertyPlist` now calls
   `prop.GetIndexParameters()` and, when non-empty, formats them via the existing
   `FormatParameterPlist` (the same helper methods and constructors already use) into a
   `:parameters` key on the property plist — structurally identical to how a method's own
   parameters are represented. An ordinary (non-indexer) property still omits `:parameters`
   entirely, so existing consumers of the metadata format are unaffected.

2. **Codegen (`assembly-package-generator.lisp`)**: a property plist carrying `:parameters` is now
   an indexer (`indexer-property-p`). Since ordinary C# properties can never be overloaded but
   indexers can (e.g. `this[int]` alongside `this[string]` on the same class — both reflect as
   distinct `PropertyInfo` entries both named `Item`), instance properties are first grouped by
   name (`group-properties-by-name`, mirroring `method-groups`'s hash-table grouping) before
   generation:
   * A group with exactly one property plist generates as before, except the getter/setter's
     lambda list and `dotnet:invoke` call now thread the index parameter(s) through positionally,
     inserted between the receiver (`obj!`) and, for the setter, the new value — matching C#'s own
     `set_Item(index..., value)` parameter order. An ordinary property (no index parameters) emits
     byte-for-byte the same code as before Version 26, since the conditional `~@[ ... ~]` `format`
     directives contribute nothing when there are no index parameters to insert.
   * A group with two or more property plists (an overloaded indexer) is **not yet supported** —
     picking which signature a single generated function should dispatch to isn't well-defined
     without the same kind of type-based `cond` dispatch overloaded methods already get. Rather
     than guess (and risk silently generating a wrapper for the wrong signature), the generator
     documents every signature in a comment and emits no function at all, mirroring the existing
     dirty-method/dirty-constructor "documented but unsupported" treatment
     (`method-signature-str`/`constructor-signature-str`'s sibling, `property-signature-str`).
   `compute-package-exports-and-shadows` (which independently determines `packages.lisp`'s
   `defpackage` exports without re-running `generate-class-file`'s own body-generation logic)
   received the identical grouping and single-signature-only-exports treatment, so it never
   exports a function name for an overloaded indexer that `generate-class-file` won't actually
   define.

## Public Instance Fields and Multi-Type-Argument Generic Methods (Version 27)

Two capability gaps, both flagged as highest-priority in
`doc/claude-suggested-improvements-20260703.md`, are addressed together in Version 27.

### Public Instance Fields

Prior to Version 27, a public instance field (e.g. a plain mutable field on a simple data-holder
class or struct) generated *nothing at all* — no getter, no setter, not even a documenting
comment the way an unsupported ("dirty") method overload gets. The predicate that should have
driven this, `public-instance-field-p`, existed but was never called anywhere in the file — a
silent, invisible gap, and arguably worse than an unsupported feature that's at least documented
in the generated output.

**Why fields need different codegen than properties.** A C# property has named accessor methods
(`get_Foo`/`set_Foo`) that the existing instance-property codegen simply invokes by name via
`dotnet:invoke`. A field has no such accessor methods — reflection reads/writes it directly.
`dotnet:invoke` (per `doc/dotnet-dotcl-interop.md` and `doc/package-dotnet.md`) does support
reading a field directly by name (its binding flags include `BindingFlags.GetField`), so the
getter is just as simple as a property's:
```lisp
(dotnet:invoke (cl:the (dotnet "Fq.Type") obj!) "FieldName")
```
But `dotnet:invoke` has no field-write equivalent — its own binding flags only cover
`GetProperty`/`GetField`, not `SetField`. Writing a field (or property, or indexer) directly is
instead the job of `dotnet:invoke`'s own `setf`-expansion (`dotnet:%set-invoke` under the hood),
which *does* include `BindingFlags.SetField`. So the setter uses that idiom directly, rather than
invoking a named setter method the way a property's setter does:
```lisp
(cl:setf (dotnet:invoke (cl:the (dotnet "Fq.Type") obj!) "FieldName") new-value)
```

**Read-only fields.** A C# `readonly` instance field reflects with `:init-only t` in the field
plist (the same flag already used for static readonly fields, `runtime-readonly-field-p`).
`InvokeMember`'s `SetField` flag would throw at runtime against a truly readonly field, so the
generator only emits a setter when `:init-only` is absent — mirroring exactly how an instance
property already only gets a setter when `:writeable` is present. The getter is always emitted
(a public field, like a public property, is always at least readable).

**Where it lives:** a new `instance-fields` binding (`(remove-if-not #'public-instance-field-p
fields)`) alongside the existing `instance-props`/`instance-prop-groups` bindings, in both
`generate-class-file` and `compute-package-exports-and-shadows`; a new codegen block placed right
after the Instance Properties block (before Methods) in `generate-class-file`; and a matching
exports-only loop in `compute-package-exports-and-shadows` (a field's getter and setf-able setter
share one Lisp symbol, so only one export entry is needed per field, exactly like properties).

### Generic Methods of Arity > 1

Prior to Version 27, `simple-method-p`/`clean-method-p` hard-restricted generic methods to
`(or (not is-generic) (eql arity 1))` — a method with two or more of its own type parameters (e.g.
LINQ's `Select<TSource,TResult>`, `Join`, `ToDictionary<TSource,TKey,TResult>`) was classified
"dirty" and skipped with a comment, the same treatment as a `ref`/`out`/`params` method. This was
a large practical gap: most of LINQ's `Enumerable` surface is multi-type-argument generic methods.

**Generalizing the wrapper's type-argument parameters.** The arity-1 wrapper (Version 12) hardcoded
a single Lisp parameter literally named `type`, passed to `dotnet:invoke-generic`/
`dotnet:static-generic` as `(cl:list type)`. `generic-type-param-names` generalizes this: arity 1
still returns the single legacy name `("type")` (so existing arity-1 generated code, and any
caller already passing that parameter positionally, is completely unaffected byte-for-byte), while
arity N > 1 returns `("type-1" "type-2" ... "type-N")`, one Lisp parameter per type argument.
`generate-single-overload`, `generate-master-wrapper`, and `format-master-overload-action` all use
this instead of the hardcoded `"type"`/`(cl:list type)`, passing `(cl:list type-1 type-2 ...)` to
`dotnet:invoke-generic`/`dotnet:static-generic` so DotCL can instantiate the method with however
many type arguments it actually needs.

`generic-method-arity-supported-p` replaces the old `(eql arity 1)` check with "any positive
integer arity", used identically by both `simple-method-p` and `clean-method-p`.

**The same-name, different-arity problem (Aggregate).** Generalizing arity alone isn't safe by
itself: C# allows the *same* method name to be overloaded across *different* generic arities.
`System.Linq.Enumerable.Aggregate` is the canonical real-world example — it has three same-named
overloads, of generic arity 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Before Version 27 this was moot, since arity
2 and 3 were simply excluded; but naively accepting all arities and merging same-named overloads
into one wrapper (the existing Master Wrapper machinery groups overloads purely by method name)
would be actively wrong: **one Lisp function's lambda list cannot flex between different numbers of
generic type-argument parameters** — a wrapper that binds `type-1 type-2` has no way to also serve
a 1-type-argument or 3-type-argument call.

The fix splits before generating:
* `method-generic-cell-key` returns a method's generic-arity "cell" identity: `nil` for a
  non-generic method, or its integer `:generic-arity` for a generic one.
* `split-by-generic-arity` partitions a method-name group's (already static/instance-partitioned,
  already "clean") overloads into one ordered sub-list per distinct cell. The overwhelmingly common
  case — every overload non-generic, or every generic overload sharing one arity (e.g. `Select`'s
  two arity-2 overloads, which differ only in an ordinary parameter's type, not generic arity) —
  produces exactly one cell, so nothing changes from how these already worked.
* `generic-arity-suffix` names a cell: `""` for non-generic, `"-arity-N"` for arity N.
* `generate-method-name-wrappers` (which replaces the four near-identical
  single-overload-or-master-wrapper call sites that used to be duplicated across the
  mixed-mode/single-mode `cond` branches in `generate-class-file`'s method loop) generates one
  function per cell, using the plain base name when there's only one cell, or the arity-suffixed
  name when there's more than one. For `Aggregate`, this produces `aggregate-arity-1`,
  `aggregate-arity-2`, and `aggregate-arity-3` instead of one broken merged function — and none of
  them claim the bare `aggregate` name, since which arity "deserves" the unsuffixed name is not
  well-defined.
* `method-name-wrapper-names` mirrors `generate-method-name-wrappers`'s naming decisions (same
  `split-by-generic-arity` call, same suffixing rule) without generating any code, so
  `compute-package-exports-and-shadows` exports exactly the set of names `generate-class-file` will
  actually define.

This same per-cell splitting applies uniformly to the mixed-mode (static + instance overloads
sharing a name) case too: `generate-method-name-wrappers` is called once for the instance-clean
list and once for the static-clean list (with the static base name already `*`-suffixed as before),
each independently split by generic arity.

## Generic-Arity Two-Tier Dispatch (Version 28)

Version 27's `-arity-N` suffixes fully solved the same-name/different-arity correctness problem
(see above), but at the cost of an unbounded public export surface: `Enumerable.Aggregate` exported
three separate names (`aggregate-arity-1`, `aggregate-arity-2`, `aggregate-arity-3`), inconsistent
with Version 24's Overload Consolidation, which keeps every other overloaded method's public surface
to at most two names (`foo`/`foo*` for instance vs. static — see "Master Wrapper with Precise
Dispatch" above). Version 28 brings generic-arity dispatch in line with that precedent: at most one
new exported name, `base-name<>` (or bare `base-name` in one case below), replaces the whole family
of arity-suffixed exports; the old per-arity bodies still exist, verbatim, but only as unexported
internal implementation details.

**Classifying a method name's generic-arity cells.** `generic-arity-dispatch-mode` looks at the
cells `split-by-generic-arity` already computes for one method name (within one static/instance
mode) and returns one of three symbols:

* `:single` — exactly one cell (the overwhelmingly common case: every overload non-generic, or every
  generic overload sharing one arity, e.g. `Select<TSource,TResult>`'s two arity-2 overloads). No
  dispatch is generated at all; `base-name` is the one and only function, byte-identical to Version
  27's (and earlier) output for this case.
* `:split-with-plain` — more than one cell, and one of them is the non-generic (`nil`-keyed) cell:
  a non-generic overload of this name coexists with generic ones at other arities. `base-name`
  handles the non-generic overload(s) only (no type argument); a new `base-name<>` dispatcher handles
  every generic cell.
* `:split-all-generic` — more than one cell, none of them non-generic (the real-world `Aggregate`
  case: arity 1, 2, and 3, with no non-generic overload at all). `base-name` itself becomes the
  dispatcher — no `<>` suffix, since there is no non-generic call form to disambiguate it from.

**The dispatcher.** `generate-generic-arity-dispatcher` emits a function (named `base-name<>` or
bare `base-name`, per the mode above) whose first parameter, `types`, accepts either a single .NET
type (a type-name string, alias, or `System.Type` object — treated as arity 1) or a `cl:list` of
types (arity = its length). `cl:listp` distinguishes the two unambiguously, since a type argument
is itself never a Lisp list. The remaining arguments are forwarded via `&rest`/`apply` straight
through to whichever internal per-arity function (`internal-arity-fn-name`, see below) the resolved
arity names — the dispatcher never needs to know that function's own lambda-list shape, which may
itself be a Master Wrapper's `&optional`/`&key` list (e.g. `group-by-arity-3`, an arity-3 cell that
is itself a 2-overload Master Wrapper). A `cl:t` fallback signals the existing
`csharp-assembly-utils:csharp-overload-not-found` condition (reused, not a new condition type) when
`types`'s length matches none of the method's known arities.

In the `:split-with-plain` case specifically, the dispatcher also accepts an **empty** list (or
`nil`) for `types`, in which case it applies straight through to the plain, non-generic `base-name`
function instead of erroring — so a caller that generically loops over "call this with N type
arguments" doesn't need to special-case N=0 into a differently-named function. This has no analogue
in `:split-all-generic`, since there is no non-generic overload to fall through to there; an empty
`types` list simply falls into the `csharp-overload-not-found` fallback in that case.

**Internal per-arity functions.** The bodies Version 27 generated under `aggregate-arity-1`,
`aggregate-arity-2`, etc. are unchanged — `generate-generic-cell-wrapper` (an extraction of the
single-overload-vs-Master-Wrapper branch that Version 27's `generate-method-name-wrappers` already
had inline) still calls `generate-single-overload`/`generate-master-wrapper` exactly as before per
cell. Only their *export status* changes: `internal-arity-fn-name` (still just
`base-name` + `generic-arity-suffix`, unchanged) names them, but `method-name-wrapper-names` no
longer lists them, so `compute-package-exports-and-shadows` never exports them. They remain
individually reachable/debuggable via `package::aggregate-arity-2` if ever needed. No new "internal"
naming convention (e.g. a `%`-prefix) was introduced for this, since none already existed anywhere
in this file to be consistent with, and reusing the proven Version-27 names/bodies verbatim is the
lowest-risk option.

**Static/instance interaction.** No change was needed to `generate-class-file`'s method loop: it
still calls `generate-method-name-wrappers` once per static/instance mode with the same arguments,
and the static base name is already `*`-suffixed *before* `generate-method-name-wrappers` ever
appends `<>` — so a name that is both mixed static/instance and multi-arity-generic correctly
becomes, e.g., `group-by*<>`, with `*` always ordered before `<>`.

**Export-list drift risk.** `method-name-wrapper-names` must always return exactly the set of names
`generate-method-name-wrappers` actually emits as top-level, non-internal `defun`s — this pairing
(already flagged as a risk point in the Version 27 section above) is the main way this feature could
silently regress: if the two functions' case-dispatch logic diverges, `packages.lisp` would either
under-export (breaking legitimate external callers) or over-export (leaking an internal
`aggregate-arity-N` name). Both functions branch on the exact same `generic-arity-dispatch-mode`
value from the exact same `split-by-generic-arity` call, which keeps them mechanically in sync, but
any future change to one must be mirrored in the other.

## Struct-Boxing Warnings Corrected; Shared-Mutable-Constant Hazard Documented (Version 29)

The "Instance Properties and Struct 'Boxing Mutation'" section above (and the comment the
generator emitted above every struct/enum property/field mutator) claimed that `setf`-mutating a
struct's property "may only mutate a boxed copy, leaving the original unchanged." That transcript
was itself suspect on inspection: it showed `color:+white+` printing as `R:37 G:255 B:255 A:255`
(White should print `R:255 ...`) and used DungeonSlime's own `#!!System.Convert.ToByte`-style
reader-macro shorthand, unavailable in this standalone repo — strong signs it was never actually
run against a live REPL, just carried over from `dotcl-dungeonslime`'s docs uncritically.

A real `make repl` session against `dotcl-dungeonslime` (which loads generated packages including
`color:`) disproved the claim outright: `x` starts as genuine White, and all three ways of
producing the new value (`dotnet:box`, a real invoked `dotnet:static` conversion call, and a
`the`-typed literal) correctly mutate `x` in place, with no error and no silently-discarded
mutation — see the corrected transcript above. **Mutation succeeds.**

**The real, more serious finding** came from one further check: `color:+white+` itself — a
`defconstant` — had been permanently mutated too:
```lisp
DUNGEON-SLIME> color:+white+
#<DOTNET Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color {R:55 G:255 B:255 A:255}>
```

**Root cause.** `(cl:defconstant +white+ (dotnet:static <type-str> "White"))` evaluates its value
form exactly once; that one call to the real C# `Color.White` getter returns one boxed CLR object,
and that *exact* box is what `+white+` is bound to for the remaining life of the program.
`(defparameter x color:+white+)` binds `x` to the *same* box — Lisp variables holding a `DOTNET`
object hold a reference, not a value-copy. Mutating a property through *either* binding mutates
that one shared box, including every other place in the program that reads `+white+` from then on,
permanently and silently. By contrast, the default (non-`--constant-properties`) path —
`(cl:define-symbol-macro local (dotnet:static <type-str> "Local"))` — re-evaluates `dotnet:static`
on *every* reference, so each access re-invokes the real C# getter, which (ordinary .NET
value-type semantics: every read of a value-type-returning member yields an independent copy)
returns a freshly-boxed instance each time. That path has no sharing hazard.

So the bug is structural to `--constant-properties` (and, in principle, true C# `:literal`/`const`
fields, though C# cannot express a non-primitive `const`, so that path is a no-op safety net in
practice, not a real-world risk today): caching a *mutable value type* into a `defconstant` silently
creates global shared mutable state disguised as an immutable constant — and the flagship examples
this repo's own `CLAUDE.md`/`README.md` give for `--constant-properties` (`Vector2.Zero`,
`Color.White`) are exactly the highest-risk case.

**The fix in this version is documentation-only — no dispatch/codegen behavior changed.**
`defconstant`'s entire point is to avoid re-invoking `dotnet:static` on every access (important for
something as hot as `Vector2.Zero`); falling back to `define-symbol-macro` for struct-typed
constants would eliminate the hazard but at an unacceptable performance cost for exactly the case
people reach for the flag for. Instead:

* The three `is-value-type-p` property/field mutator comment sites in `generate-class-file` were
  reworded to describe the *actual* hazard (in-place mutation of a possibly-aliased boxed instance)
  instead of the disproven "mutation is silently lost" claim.
* A new `emit-shared-mutable-constant-warning` helper emits a detailed warning comment above every
  `literal-fields`/`pure-const-fields`/`pure-const-props` `defconstant` whose type is not a
  known-safe, effectively-immutable primitive (`immutable-primitive-type-p`, checked against a new
  `*immutable-primitive-types*` allowlist of numeric primitives, `System.String`, `System.Char`,
  `System.Boolean`, `System.IntPtr`/`UIntPtr`). This is deliberately a broad allowlist rather than a
  precise per-type mutability check: `generate-class-file` only ever sees one type's own metadata at
  a time, with no cross-type lookup available to determine whether some *other* referenced type
  (e.g. a constant property returning a type declared in a different assembly) has settable
  instance members — so anything not provably safe gets the warning, including every struct with
  settable properties/fields.
* `*generator-version*` bumped 28 → 29 since generated file *text* changes (comments), matching this
  repo's precedent for comment/wording-only version bumps (e.g. Version 25).

**What this version does *not* do**, per explicit user direction: it does not touch the separate,
similar-sounding Version 16 "Struct Mutation, Boxing, and Overload Resolution" section's claim about
struct-mutating *instance methods* (e.g. `Vector2.Normalize()`) discarding their mutation — that
claim was not tested in this investigation (only property `setf` was), and is left as-is pending
independent live verification.

**Real follow-up work, not delivered here:** users currently have no supported way to obtain an
independent, safely-mutable *copy* of a boxed struct (from a constant, a symbol-macro, or any other
source) — see `PLAN.md`'s new struct-cloning TODO item for the tracked follow-up to actually solve
the underlying hazard rather than just warn about it.
